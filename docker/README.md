# cs-fastly-bouncer

This bouncer creates VCL rules and modifies ACL lists of the provided fastly services according to decisions provided by CrowdSec

#@ Installation using docker image

The bouncer needs config file which contains details about fastly services, tokens etc.

You can auto generate most of the config via:

```
docker run \
crowdsecurity/fastly-bouncer \
-g <FASTLY_TOKEN_1>,<FASTLY_TOKEN_2> > cfg.yaml
```

Now in the `cfg.yaml` file fill values of 

- `recaptcha_secret_key` and `recaptcha_site_key`: See instructions about obtaining them [here](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin). This would allow captcha remediations.

- `lapi_key` and `lapi_url`:  The `lapi_url` is where crowdsec LAPI is listening. Make sure the container can access this URL. The `lapi_key` can be obtained by running 
```bash
sudo cscli bouncers add fastlybouncer
```

- Also make sure the logs are emitted to stdout by setting value of `log_mode` to `stdout`.

After reviewing the `cfg.yaml` file, let's create a cache file which we will later mount to the container.

```
touch cache.json
```


Finally let's run the bouncer:

```
docker run\
-v $PWD/cfg.yaml:/etc/crowdsec/bouncers/crowdsec-fastly-bouncer.yaml\
-v $PWD/cache.json/:/var/lib/crowdsec/crowdsec-fastly-bouncer/cache/fastly-cache.json\
crowdsecurity/fastly-bouncer
```
